Someone started forkbomb on your system how would you stop it? Google

How would you troubleshoot network communication between two servers?

Question: You are seeing the high workload on your CPU. How would you identify the problem? Facebook

Now there can be two cases:
1) It is happening because of CPU intensive processes
2) Or it may be due to high I/O.
Next you need to narrow down these cases by using various tools. Use top command to check I/O WA time. Checkout utime command. Find out which process is causing this trouble. Then use strace or perf command to find out which function is causing the problem. Then check out which system calls this function is generating. This problem was because of the RAID in the file system. RAID performs sync operation after a specific duration and during that it freezes all read/write operations, From the system call list, you can find out the file system path. Use mount command to find out filesystem type. Now check the configurations and solve it.
Question: You are trying to run the command but it says no more PIDs available. What can be the reason? How will you solve the issue? Google

Try to think about it from every aspects. There can be following cases
1) ulimit for your user/group is set to very low. You can't create processes more than ulimit range.
2) Someone started fork bomb. There are no PIDs available actually.
3) All PIDs have specific fd in the file system. You are running out of inodes.
Unable to boot OS. What can be the issue?
